I'm majoring in Computer Science right now, kind of
figuring out what I want to do with college and life.

I'm not sure what my favorite food is, but a couple days ago
I made this super good roast beef & cheddar sandwich
and melted the cheese over the roast beef in the oven
and it was super good,
so that might be it currently.

My favorite color is green.

Animals annoy me.

The end.
